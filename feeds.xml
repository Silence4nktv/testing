    <description><![CDATA[<p>The game that brought Nintendo's highly acclaimed adventure series into the third dimension now is brought ... into the third dimension! This Nintendo 3DS remake of the classic game gives players another chance to romp through the land of Hyrule, now with 3D effects added to bring the series to life like never before. After a nightmare involving a certain young princess and the evil thief Ganondorf, series hero Link wakes up in his home village tucked away behind the mysterious Lost Woods. The only Kokiri without a fairy, Link soon meets up with his new traveling companion, the winged Navi, and sets out on the adventure of his life. The quest, which inevitably turns into a rescue mission for Princess Zelda, leads players through dark dungeons, picturesque villages, into the heart of a volcano, to the bottom of a lake, through a haunted desert, deep into a magical forest, into a giant tree, the belly of a beast, and even through time.</p>]]></description>
